=== ANALYSIS NOTES ===
1. Lexically different but semantically close:
   - Sentences [0] and [1]: 'astronomers observed' vs 'Stargazers used an optical instrument'.
     Different words, but high cosine similarity because the meaning is almost identical.

2. Lexically similar but semantically far apart:
   - Sentences [6] and [7]: 'The Jaguar' (car) vs 'The jaguar' (animal).
     High lexical overlap ('Jaguar', 'The') but the context differentiates them (highway vs jungle).
     Ideally, the model should separate them, though similarity might still be moderate due to shared words.
